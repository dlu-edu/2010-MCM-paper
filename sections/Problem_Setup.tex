\section{Problem Setup}

In this paper, we approach the problem in three main portions:

\begin{itemize}

\item The position of the sweet spot on the bat.

\item The impact on the sweet spot of the corked bat produces.

\item The differences the different materials bat make.
\end{itemize}

First, we create a plane mechanics model to solve the three portions. Next we establish a computer model to solve the three portions better. What's more, we have evaluated the influence of the sweet spot makes, and also solved why the corked bat and the aluminum bat are prohibited.
