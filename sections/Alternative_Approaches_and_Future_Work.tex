\section{Alternative Approaches and Future Work}

There were several extensions to our model and simulation that we could not pursue due to the time constraint. We considered evaluating the ``sweet spot" effect of different bat by counting the probability of take the sack and the probability of home runs. We would then be able to compare advantages and disadvantages of different bat in practical baseball field.
